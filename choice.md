# [Is Linux About]({{ site.baseurl }}/) Choice?

## No.

Red Hat's Adam Jackson [put it nicely](https://listman.redhat.com/archives/fedora-devel-list/2008-January/msg00861.html):

>As a consumer, yes, you have lots of choices in which Linux you use.
This does not mean Linux is in any sense _about_ choice, any more than
because there are so many kinds of cars you can buy that cars are about
choice.

This was even turned into [a bit of a meme site](http://islinuxaboutchoice.com) that inspired the original version of _this_ website!

Then again…

## Maybe?

The above was from a bit of a rant on a mailing list discussing low-level decisions that are being made by Linux distributions. When it comes to the end user, sure, “Linux” can be about choice: the freedom to choose and install any of the plentiful options of Linux-based operating systems available.

However, that doesn't mean that any particular Linux-based OS, desktop environment, ecosystem, or even app needs to offer any "choice" inherently whatsoever. Just as a user is free to choose to use a specific thing, the developer of that thing is free to choose what to implement.
