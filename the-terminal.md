# [Is Linux About]({{ site.baseurl }}/) the Terminal?

## No.

While the command line is an awesome part of what you can do with most Linux-based operating systems, it's not necessary to know anything about it to use and love a Linux-based OS.

- **Android** is based on the Linux kernel, has billions of users around the world, and **does not expose the command line.**

- **Chrome OS** is a popular Linux-based OS that **does not expose a terminal.**

- **elementary OS** is designed to get out of the way for both experienced Linux users and users coming from other operating systems who have **never seen a command line**; and it's loved by both.

- Technically, the command line most used in Linux-based OSes is **not even implemented by Linux itself**, but by GNU [Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) and [Coreutils](https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/). Not every distribution of Linux comes with or makes these accessible.
