# [Is Linux About]({{ site.baseurl }}/) Themes?

## No.

Linux is a kernel, and has nothing to do with themes. While some desktop environments and underlying technologies of Linux-based desktop OSes may expose some sort of theming capability, it's equally valid if a Linux-based desktop offers no theming at all.

- [FreeDesktop.org](https://freedesktop.org) specifications try to ensure different desktops' styling and features are intercompatible.

- Several app developers are calling for Linux distributions and downstreams to [stop theming their apps](https://stopthemingmy.app/).

- [elementary OS](https://elementary.io) does not support themes.

- [GNOME](https://gnome.org) offers no official support for themes, though there are [efforts to improve the situation](https://discourse.gnome.org/t/gtk-adwaita-and-vendor-styles/1641) with downstream distributors.
