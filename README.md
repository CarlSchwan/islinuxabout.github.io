Linux is a kernel. Is Linux about:

- …[apps](apps)?
- …[choice](choice)?
- …[politics](politics)?
- …[systray](systray)?
- …[themes](themes)?
- …[the terminal](terminal)?

Linux-based desktop OSes _do_ try to work together. That’s called the [FreeDesktop](https://freedesktop.org), and it’s awesome.
