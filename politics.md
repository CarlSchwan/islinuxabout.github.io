# [Is Linux About]({{ site.baseurl }}/) Politics?

## Perhaps.

Linux is a [free/libre and open source](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html) kernel explicitly released under the [GNU General Public License](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/licenses.html). It was created as an alternative to the proprietary Unixes of the time.

Free Software is all about providing essential freedoms/liberties to all users of the software. The Linux kernel also enforces a progressive [Code of Conduct](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/code-of-conduct.html) for contributors. These could both be seen as a political stance, and thus **Linux could be considered political.**

At the same time, the Linux kernel is just code, and can be used by anyone for any purposeâ€”politics aside. In this way, **Linux could be considered apolitical.**
