# [Is Linux About]({{ site.baseurl }}/) Apps?

## No.

Linux is a kernel, not an app platform. While you can use some apps across several different Linux-based OSes, the best apps are designed to integrate with a specific platform like GNOME, KDE, elementary OS, etc.

- Technologies like [Flatpak](https://flatpak.org) and [Snap](https://snapcraft.io) claim to be _the_ solution to apps on Linux and let you use apps across desktops, but **don't guarantee perfect system integration.**

- [FreeDesktop.org](https://freedesktop.org) specifications ensure _some_ amount of cross-compatibility between Linux-based desktops, but **not all specs are implemented by all desktops.**

- Some platforms like [elementary OS AppCenter](https://developer.elementary.io) **require apps to use the native toolkit** for the OS.

- The [Linux App Summit](https://linuxappsummit.org/) is trying to help **create and grow a broad "Linux app ecosystem."**
